# chat-application
This is a chat application designed to create reproduce WhatsApp web functionality where the data is stored on the device and needs a websocket connection to pull data from the said device.  Ill probably use velocity mo.js for animations if required.

<h2>Goals of this application : </h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a chat app in ionic 3 with data stored locally on the device.</li>
  <li>Create a web app which will then connect to the mobile device and pull data from there.</li>
  <li>Get used to angular 4 framework.</li>
  <li>Get used to Ionic 3 framework</li>
  <li>Later create the same front end in React.(may be in a different repository.)</li>
  <li>Make use chromes fileapi or indexedDB</li>
  <li>For the backend I might use either node.js or Firebase. While node.js is not really used for realtime chat applications the goal
  here is to learn the overall architecture and the problems with such a design.</li>
</ol>
